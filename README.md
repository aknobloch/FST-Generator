# FST-Generator
Created : September 2015

FST Generator is a convenience program for importing characters made with Autodesk Character Generator into fsStudio, the FaceShift markerless motion capture software. 

The program allows you to select an FBX file exported by the Autodesk Character Generator. It then generates an .FST file which can be loaded in fsStudio. The .FST file allows fsStudio to detect approprate joints and keyshapes for the character to be able to be animated using the fsStudio software. Due to the vast variety of possible characters, some minor tweaking might be needed.

There is one known bug addressed in the Issues section.
